# Cybershoes Quest SDK Developer Handbook for Unity
*Thoroughly tested in Unity 2019.4.9f1 using Oculus Utility Plugin 1.40*  
*Shortly tested in Unity 2020.1.6f1 using Oculus Utility Plugin 1.52*

**Abstract:**  
Cybershoes example project usable in Quest development.  
Shoe input appears as gamepad input.  
The example illustrates how to get gamepad input and suggests solutions for a seated play mode.  
Testing gamepad functionality can either be done using the shoes, or if they're not available using a bluetooth gamepad (e.g., an Xbox One gamepad).

*Please note that shoe movement is always relative to the rotation of the hmd.*  
*Walking forward while looking to the side should result in strafing.*  
*All directions of movement should have the same movement speed multiplier.*

## Cybershoes SDK Scripts Details
### CybershoesInput.cs
**Public function GetRotatedShoeVector():**  
Takes the forward rotation of your hmd, e.g., yourCameraRig.centerEyeAnchor.rotation and input from a gamepad.  
The shoes are treated as a Bluetooth gamepad by their driver software.  
Bluetooth package loss is mitigated by GetRotatedShoeVector to return the most accurate current shoe rotation.  
  
### CybershoesHeightScaler.cs
**Public function InitHeightScaler():**  
Takes the transform component of your hmd and a float that signifies how tall your player should be in a standing position in meters, e.g., yourCameraRig.centerEyeAnchor and 1.75f.  
Both parameters are then assigned to member variables of the HeightScaler script. Initialize the height scaler at the moment of calibrating the player height.  
You should adjust the size of your player character model, if you have one, to the target standing height of the player.  

**Public function CalculateOffset():**  
Returns the difference of your target player standing height (simulated) and the current seated user height (real).  
The goal of CalculateOffset is that the returned value may then be used to position the player camera as if the user were standing instead of being seated.  
Moving the camera leads to the chaperone being moved in the y-direction as well which leads to users not being able to pick up items off the ground.  
CalculateOffset incorporates a mitigation tactic that looks whether a user is bending down towards the ground and moves the player position in the y-direction accordingly.  
This is incorporated into the return value of CalculateOffset.  

## How to use the Example Project
The example project uses the player controller and local avatar prefabs included in the Oculus Utilities Plugin with the tracking origin type of the OVRCameraRig set to floor level.  
It is, however, possible to implement the Cybershoes specific functionality shown in this project in other camera/player controller setups.  
Prerequisites to implement your own Cybershoes functionality would be to have a way of getting gamepad input and being able to move the player camera freely.  
Some setups might require workarounds to be able to move the player camera in the y-direction freely.  

Open the project using UnityHub and then open the CybershoesSampleScene in Unity.  
Make sure to deny upgrading APIs if Unity shows you the prompt.  
Open the Build Settings, set the platform to Android and select ASTC in the Texture Compression menu point. Make sure that the CybershoesSampleScene is listed under Scenes In Build.  
Connect your Quest with activated developer mode to your PC and click Build And Run.  

The scene provides three cubes, all with a size of 1 meters. Two of them are stacked to create a construct that is 2 meters tall.    
Additionally a sphere that is grabbable using the Touch Controller's grip button.  
  
### CybershoesManager.cs
This script implements height scaling functionality and handles input taken from the shoes.  
The useProfileData member variable of the Oculus player controller is set to false to make the camera movable in the y-direction.  
Damping movement to the back and sides is set to 1, thereby turning damping off to guarantee that using the shoes, players move in all directions at the same speed.  
To counteract the player controller being positioned at y = 1, the camera rig is moved in the negative y-direction by 1 unit.  

The IntitHeightScaler function is invoked using a helper function in Start. This function is called with a delay of one second. The delay is necessary to initialize the height scaler successfully.   
InitHeightScaler is called using the center eye anchor of the OVRCameraRig with a target player standing height of 1.75m.  
The CalculateOffset function of the CybershoesHeightScaler script is used in Update to apply the offset to the player camera.  
In order for height scaling to apply the correct offset each frame, the player camera gets moved into the negative y-direction of the offset added in the frame before the current one.  
Then the offset calculated in the current frame is used to move the player camera in the positive y-direction (upwards).  
To showcase the functionality of the height scaler, it is activated after 1 second, then deactivated after 30 seconds and then activated again after 40 seconds.  
DeactivateCybershoesHeightScaler shows an example of turning height scaling off.  
This is done by calling InitHeightScaler with null and 0 to set the member variables in the CybershoesHeightScaler script to values that return 0 as the offset.    

**Private function GetCybershoesInput():**  
Example implementation of constructing a three-dimensional vector by calling the GetRotatedShoeVector function.  
GetRotatedShoeVector takes a 2D vector detailing the current state of the primary thumbstick of a gamepad and returns an adjusted two-dimensional vector of the x and y movement of the shoes.  
The 2D x value is used for the 3D x value, while the 2D y value is used for the 3D z value.  
This three-dimensional vector is then used to move the player in Update including Time.deltaTime to make movement framerate independent.  
The example implementation uses Unity's InputSystem to query the current state of the gamepad thumbstick.
The InputSystem first had to be installed from Window -> Package Manager  
and the active input handling in Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings to both.  
You are, however, free to use your own solution of getting the thumbstick state and passing it to the GetRotatedShoeVector function.  

*Note: In some versions of the Oculus Utilities Plugin the OVRPlayerController automatically adjusts the gamepad input to follow the rotation of the hmd.*  
*If that is not the case, modify this function as detailed below to make player movement follow the rotation of the hmd.*    
```c#
Quaternion hmdRotation = oculusCameraRig.centerEyeAnchor.rotation;
hmdRotation.x = 0;
hmdRotation.z = 0;
Vector3 characterMovement = hmdRotation * new Vector3(adjustedShoeMovement.x * Time.deltaTime * 0.5f, 0, adjustedShoeMovement.y * Time.deltaTime * 0.5f);
```

### StaticHeightScaling.cs
This script poses as an alternative to height scaling. Activate this script and deactivate the CybershoesManager script to see the effect.  

**Private function ActivateSimulatedHeight():**  
Example implementation of using a fixed offset to simulate the height that a user would have when standing instead of being seated.  
Some games might have a way of picking up items from the ground regardless where the chaperone might be positioned.  
Using a fixed offset instead of height scaling may be more feasible and straightforward for such games.  
In this example, useProfileData is set to false to be able to move the camera in the y-direction.  
The local position of the camera is then set to a negative value due to the player controller being positioned at y = 1.  
The offset you want to achieve is calculated by adding 1 to the value you position the camera at (in this example, 1 + (-0.7) = 0.3 units offset).  
We recommend using an offset-value of 0.3 or 0.4 units, which will put your player height at approximately 1.7 to 1.8 meters, assuming that the user is sitting on a Cyberchair.  
If you use player models, be aware that you have to scale them to the new height.  

**Private function DeactivateSimulatedHeight():**  
Example implementation of no longer using a fixed offset.  
In this example, UseProfileData is simply set to true, to revert the camera position to the original height.
